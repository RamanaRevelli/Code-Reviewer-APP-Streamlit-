# Code-Reviewer-APP-Streamlit-
This code implements a simple Streamlit web application that leverages the OpenAI API to generate code corrections. The application allows users to input code snippets, and upon clicking the "Generate" button, it sends the input code to the OpenAI model for processing. The model then identifies any bugs in the code and provides a corrected version.
